    <h1>ccLab Project A: Creature Profile</h1>
    <img width="800px" src="projectA prototype.jpg" alt="Creature">
    <h3>1. Scientific Name of the Creature:</h3>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Lord of the Flies</p>

    <h3>2. Discovered by (Scientist’s Name) / at (Time of Discovery):</h3>
    <p>Discovered by ??? in 1941 (too old, can’t find information)</p>

    <h3>3. Family:</h3>
    <p>Haven’t seen any similar creatures yet. Somehow it seems like a leader of a bunch of other kinds of insects
        because they are fetching food only for the creature itself</p>

    <h3>4. Habitat:</h3>
    <p>Under urban flyovers, in the polluted vegetation composed of vines and mosses.</p>

    <h3>5. Appearance:</h3>
    <p>It looks like a very ordinary caterpillar at the beginning of its life. Rapidly grows into a huge moth with only
        one mysterious eye. Then it would be eaten by its own wings and form a cocoon to be reborn.</p>

    <h3>6. Key Characteristics:</h3>
    <p>It has a strong will to gain unlimited strength in its limited life. Somehow it seems like it is the strength
        that makes its life short.</p>

    <h3>7. What do we know so far about the creature?</h3>
    <p>It has a very mysterious mechanism of being infinitely reborn. Probably have the ability to control other
        creatures’ minds because the scientists would automatically feed the creatures without noticing their own
        actions.</p>

    <h3>8. How do we interact with this creature?</h3>
    <p style="color:darkred; font-weight: bold">Feed it. Make it satisfied. Never disobey.</p>
